   # Create a Kelly Criterion strategy
   strategy = KellyCriterion(payoff=1.0, loss=1.0, transaction_cost=0.01)

   # Create a simulator with a fixed probability
   simulator = RepeatedBinarySimulator(
       payoff=1.0, 
       loss=1.0, 
       transaction_costs=0.01, 
       probability=0.55,  # 55% chance of winning
